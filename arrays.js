//Activity 7
//A for loop is usually used when the number of iterations is known.
//And while and do...while loops are usually used when the number of iterations are unknown.
//Example of each
// program to display numbers
// do...while loop from 1 to 5

let i = ("1");
const n = 5;
do {
    console.log("i");
    i++;
} while(i <= n);


//example for loop
// this loop is iterated 5 times
for (let i = 1; i <=5; ++i) {
    // body of loop
 }


 //example while loop
while (condition) {
    // body of loop
}


//do while loop is a control flow statement that executes a block of code and then either 
//repeats the block or exits the loop depending on a given boolean condition.
//The do while construct consists of a process symbol and a condition.

//Example
do {
    // body of loop
} while(condition)

//The body of the loop is executed at first. Then the condition is evaluated.
//If the condition evaluates to true, the body of the loop inside the do statement is executed again.
//The condition is evaluated once again.
//If the condition evaluates to true, the body of the loop inside the do statement is executed again.
//This process continues until the condition evaluates to false. Then the loop stops.
//do...while loop is similar to the while loop. The only difference is that in doâ€¦while loop, the body of loop is executed at least once.


//pros 
//The main advantage of a for loop over a while loop is readability. 
//A For loop is a lot cleaner and a lot nicer to look at. 
//code reusability

//cons
//It's also much easier to get stuck in an infinite loop with a while loop.
//if you fail to put a condition statement you will have an infinite loop
